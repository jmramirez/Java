ALL test data input files and text output data files should be in this
directory.

This directory is not defined in the description of the Java Development
Environment that appears in The Java Tutorial.  However, it is not
normal to mix data with either source code or complied code.  It is normal
in the real world to keep data in its own directory.

Normally (and certainly at the beginning of this course) ALL the input
files to be read from standard input and all the output files produced by
the programs you are required to write should be ASCII TEXT files and
therefore be processable by industry-standard text editors and other
text utility programs.

In recent semesters, students have found various ways of producing files
that are NOT ASCII TEXT files and they are NOT ACCEPTABLE.

To test the type of a file use the following Linux command

		file filename # for a single file
		of
		file *        # for all files in the current directory

This same requirement also applies to ALL *.java files.
